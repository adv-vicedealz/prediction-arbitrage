## Famous Traders & Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The French Whale (Théo)

**The Most Profitable Prediction Market Trade in History**

#### Profile

|-----------|---------|
| **Name** | Théo (pseudonym, full name not disclosed) |
| **Nationality** | French |
| **Background** | Former bank trader, lived in US |
| **Appearance** | "Short, neatly trimmed beard," gray Nike sweatshirt |
| **Net Worth (pre-trade)** | Substantial but undisclosed |

#### The Trade

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Deployed** | $85 million |
| **Profit** | $48+ million |
| **ROI** | ~56% |
| **Bet** | Trump wins 2024 election |
| **Accounts Used** | 11 (Fredi9999, Theo4, PrincessCaro, Michie, etc.) |

#### Strategy

**1. Alternative Data Discovery**:
- Found academic literature on "social circle polling"
- Methodology: Ask "Who are your neighbors voting for?" instead of "Who are you voting for?"
- These polls showed Trump overperforming

**2. Proprietary Research**:
- Commissioned YouGov poll using neighbor methodology
- Asked about three swing states
- Results confirmed his thesis

**3. Position Building**:
- Initial $30 million position before YouGov poll
- After confirming data, increased to $80 million
- "Sold off virtually all his liquid assets"
- Used 11 accounts to obscure position size

**4. Execution Tactics**:
- Accumulated over months
- Bought during natural volatility
- Stepped in during panic selling on negative Trump news
- Multi-wallet approach prevented whale detection

#### Key Insight
> Traditional polls failed to account for the "shy Trump voter effect." The neighbor question captured what people wouldn't admit about themselves.

#### Aftermath
- France's Autorité Nationale des Jeux (ANJ) investigated
- Contributed to France blocking Polymarket
- Trade validated prediction markets' credibility
