# Prediction Markets Industry Overview

## What Are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets are exchange-traded platforms where participants buy and sell contracts based on the outcomes of future events. Unlike traditional betting, these markets aggregate collective intelligence through price discovery, theoretically producing probability estimates more accurate than polls or expert forecasts.

**Core Mechanics:**
- Binary contracts trade between $0 and $1 (or 0-100 cents)
- Contract price = implied probability of outcome
- Example: If "Trump wins 2024" trades at $0.60, market implies 60% probability
- Winning contracts pay $1; losing contracts pay $0
- Profit = $1 - purchase price (for winners)
