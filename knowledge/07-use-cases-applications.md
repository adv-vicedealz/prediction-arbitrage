## 1. Political Forecasting

### Election Markets

**Available Contracts**:
- Presidential elections (winner, popular vote margin, electoral votes)
- Congressional control (Senate, House)
- State-level races
- International elections

**2024 US Election Example**:
| Platform | Volume | Accuracy |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Polymarket | $3.7 billion | Predicted Trump correctly |
| Kalshi | $527 million | Predicted Trump correctly |

**Value Proposition**:
- Real-time probability updates
- Aggregate thousands of informed participants
- React faster to events than polls

### Policy & Appointments

**Example Markets**:
- "Will Fed cut rates in March?"
- "Will [nominee] be confirmed as [position]?"
- "Will [legislation] pass?"
- "Will US default on debt?"

**Use Case**: Journalists, policy analysts, and businesses use prices as real-time policy indicators.

## 2. Sports Prediction

### Post-Election Growth Driver

After 2024 election, sports became dominant category:

| Season futures | "Who wins Super Bowl?" |
| Awards | "Who wins MVP?" |

### Regulatory Challenge

**The State Conflict**:
- States argue sports contracts = sports betting
- Requires state gambling license
