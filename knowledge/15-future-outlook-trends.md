## Conclusion: The Big Picture

**2025-2030 represents a defining period for prediction markets.**

The industry will either:
1. **Achieve mainstream financial infrastructure status** - integrated into trading, risk management, and decision-making
2. **Remain a niche speculation venue** - limited by regulatory constraints and manipulation concerns

**Key Determinants**:
- Supreme Court ruling on federal vs. state authority
- Success of institutional data products
- AI agent reliability and adoption
- Platform ability to combat manipulation

**Most Likely Outcome**: Prediction markets become a standard component of financial infrastructure, with $50-100B+ annual volume by 2030, but geographically fragmented based on regulatory outcomes.
